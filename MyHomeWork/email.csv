Dear Irini.
 
It seems the production is already released and almost completed for material 1662 G MOD 38C (110 kgs). 
If we were to repack into 100 kgs delivery date may be impacted. Let me check internally. 
 
Please be informed that the fill sizes for this material  1662 G MOD 38C is 205 / 110 / 57 / 28 kgs per drum.   
We always recommend the customer to order as per available drum size as we fill our drums to a certain level following latest regulations and safety instructions. keeping quality. safety and sustainability in mind.
 
Quality.  The headspace in a drum. which over time can cause oxidation of the fragrance. is kept to a minimum.
Safety.  Keeping the headspace to a minimum reduces possible sloshing (weight shifting) during transportation.
Sustainability.  Less waist (packaging) per shipped kilogram. less transport per shipped kilogram.
 
Thank you for your reconsideration. I am looking forward to receiving your reply how you wish to proceed. 
 
Dear Marleen.
We can’t accept the packaging of 110kg because JnJ doesn’t have 110kg package approved!! Their approved packages are 25. 75 & 100kg
I fully understand your point but please just send us 1 drum of 100kg.

Dear Irini.
 
I’ve booked the order. IFF reference is 1005564330. Please note that I’ve increased item 2 from 100 kg into 110 kg. In this case the maximum filling for this fragrance is 1*110 kg. Therefore we prefer to fill the drum till 110 kg. due to safety and the quality of the material. 
I hope this will not be a problem for you. Could you please confirm and update your order to 1*110 kg.

• Page 2 =  Johnson & Johnson’s RM Spec page 5 showing Shelf Life at 6 months.  
o Current RM Spec # is.  RM-015379. Rev 5

With this information. will Johnson & Johnson now change the RM Spec RM-015379 to 12 months shelf life?

Would you please let me know.

Dear Steven.
 
This email to inform you that it was requested to extend our shelf life for code 655133  - GLYCERINE PHARMA GRADE. used for Visine. Currently. we use a shelf life of 1 year. The supplier of this raw material has extended the shelf life period from one to two years. Supplier has stability data available. see mail received last year from supplier.
Prolongation of storage period of Edenor G 99.8 PH in closed original packaging
Dear valued customer.

We are pleased to inform you today that we are able to extend the stability period of Edenor G® 99.8 PH in the sealed original container (drums and/or IBC) while maintaining the storage temperature of max. 25 ° C from one to two years.

The extension is based on stability tests carried out in the original packaging over 2 years. which have shown that the goods are within specification for this period of time.

This change will be implemented for all batches that will be filled up into drums or IBC after the 1st of June 2017. The corresponding re-certification date is noted on the packaging labels as well as on the certificate of analysis.
Please understand that this change cannot be implemented for batches we currently have on stock or short deliveries.
Since a change in shelf life requires also spec update. I wanted to know if you see any concerns. Can you please advise?
Kind regards.
Annelene

Good morning Graeme.
 
Hope all is well.  J&J/Neutrogena has rejected 480 kg of SP INCROQUAT BEHENYL TMS MBAL-PA-(MH). total order value is $3.456.00.  I have included the long text from the complaint below.  Will you approve this return and advise who is responsible for the return freight?  Also. will there be a restocking fee?
 
Customer is rejecting this material. batch 0001304526. because it is short on shelf life according to their internal spec.  Material was manufactured 11/27/17. and according to their internal spec it expires 5/27/19.  They are requesting to return the material for full credit.  I have sent them 100 kg of the 4B01 code as replacement to get them through immediate production.
 
SP INCROQUAT BEHENYL TMS MBAL-PA-(MH) HA41040/0080/4F40 is an exclusive code for J&J and their contract manufacturers.
 
Credit.  480 kg  X  $7.20/kg = $3.456.00

Good Afternoon Greg.

Accupac’s most recent receipt of material RM-004584 was received from Ashland with a mfg date of 4/26/18.  Per spec RM-004584 Rev 7. this material has a 12-month shelf life and the material should be considered expired upon receipt and rejected.  Ashland’s CoA states material is best used within 3 years of date of manufacture and after speaking with a representative from Ashland. they had advised they refuse to follow J&J’s material specification requirements and will not have any additional material available from another lot to send Accupac.

Would J&J be willing to update their specification to align with Ashland’s shelf life requirements – or permit Accupac to use the material received in commercial production based on Ashland’s material shelf life?

Accupac needs this material for scheduled manufacturing starting 10/9/19 and micro testing is required.

We will continue to make Structure PS-111 at our current site in Salisbury. NC during your review and approval of Chattanooga.  

We have manufactured three commercial lots in Chattanooga and have a summary report that are now ready for review by your RMC team. 
Please let us know where to send the samples and report.  Our goal is to be able to supply J&J from our Chattanooga. TN location by Q3 2019.

Thank you for the assistance.
Mark.

Dear Len.

I hope this message finds you well and that you enjoyed a nice Thanksgiving break.  

I wanted to share some exciting news from INOLEX ahead of the formal notification to J&J.  We are delighted to announce the establishment of new manufacturing operations in Charlotte. NC – the attached letter provides more details.  

Understanding that the Raw Materials Center will be tasked with completing most of the change management work on the J&J end. I wanted to personally bring this to your attention and let you know that INOLEX is fully prepared to support J&J through the transition in manufacturing locations.  INOLEX recognizes that J&J will have perhaps the most stringent QA requirements for qualification of raw materials coming from the new manufacturing location. and we are ready to help J&J facilitate the transition as quickly and as smoothly as possible.

On behalf of Art Knox (VP. Global Head of Sales) and Jeff Caruso (Global Key Account Director). we will gladly pay a visit to you and your team in Skillman to discuss any questions or concerns that you may have regarding INOLEX’s new manufacturing location.  Art and Jeff are cc.ed on this message and Jeff can take the lead on scheduling a visit at your convenience.  We would also welcome a key contact appointed from your team to coordinate with INOLEX so that we can ensure clear communications and timely follow-ups on any J&J requests associated with the transition.

I look forward to speaking with you soon.

Thanks. and Best Regards.

Subject. Unqualified Abil EM 180 at KIK
Importance. High

Hi Team. 

I received a note from Aric Glass this morning regarding a shipment of Abil EM 180 to KIK Rexdale.

Background. Abil EM 180 (manufactured by Evonik) is currently qualified onto RM-013708 (NA) and RM-015578 (APAC). The RM is single sourced from Evonik’s Essen. Germany manufacturing site. Evonik sent Abil EM 180 manufactured at their Hopewell. VA facility to KIK and Evonik said that they want us to qualify this Hopewell. VA site. 

I did some digging through EtQ and I don’t see any open projects for this new manufacturing site. 

Questions. 

 Did we receive this notification from Evonik in our mailbox? 
- Quick scan through the emails and it doesn’t look like we received this notification but please confirm

 Is Evonik able to replace the unqualified material with Abil EM 180 made at their Essen site?
- If not. how quickly do we need this new site qualified?

 APAC also uses this RM. Is the new manufacturing site needed there too?

@Raw Material Center Quality can you please assess the change and bring it to triage this upcoming week?

Best Regards.

Subject. [EXTERNAL] RE. NDC Information Request for Zinc Oxide Material

You are welcome. Andra.

We no longer use the “Zoco” trade name and have not replaced it with anything and do not intend to. Since the grade differentiation is due to the “surface area” of zinc oxide and since surface area is not a USP monograph characteristic. the registration is for zinc oxide only which covers both the Grade 112 USP and Grade 102 USP . 

So these NDCs would be applicable to all our USP grades of zinc oxide you get including the ZOCO Zinc Oxide Grade 112 USP and Zoco Zinc Oxide 102 USP. 

Also note that when the trade name existed. there was no differentiation between “Zoco” and “ZOCO”.
